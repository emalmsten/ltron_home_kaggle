This is the shadow libraries root folder. Shadow locations can be used to add extra information to existing LDraw library files without the need to modify the original files. This is done by merging identical named items located in a shadow location with its master library location.

You can add additional / custom shadow libraries if needed, but keep in mind the default ones will be overwritten during an update. So be sure to use a copy when modifying an existing LDCad shadow library.
