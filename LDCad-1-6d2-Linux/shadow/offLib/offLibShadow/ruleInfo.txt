------======Angles======------
Use plenty of digits for sin/cos values,
  or it WILL affect snapping precision in the y direction of the info.

for example:
45 deg sin: 0.70710678
60 deg sin: 0.86602544



------======Rotation======------
All info points into the negative Y-axis when at rest.
 some alternative ori values are:

Neg Y (base)  1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
Pos Y         1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1

Neg X         0 1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1
Pos X         0 -1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1

Neg Z         1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 1 0
Pos Z         1 0 0 0 0 1 0 -1 0
