This is the default shadow library for the official LDraw parts library (at the time of LDCad's release). Its main purpose is to add snapping and mirroring information to a growing collection of (offical) parts.

Please note this collection is in no means complete / finished. The official library contains over 8000 parts and defining accurate snap info for all of them takes a lot of work/time. So please be patient if some part doesn't (fully) 'snap' jet.

Do not edit the contents they will be overwritten during LDCad updates. If you want to change / add something you can do that be creating a second shadow library by copying this one, and link that one to the LDraw library instead.

If you create useful additions to the shadow library, you might want to send them to me so everybody can use the additional information for part snapping.
