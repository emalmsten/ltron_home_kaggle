By default the LDCad official shadow content is supplied as a csl (Compressed Shadow Library == plain zip) file. It will be used as is, you don't need to unpack them.

Using a compressed archive will prevent wasting disc space as a result of the many small files, it will also speed up loading.

For more details about a library itself, see the readme.txt file inside it's containing archive.
